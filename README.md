## Wolfmedia

The problem is to design and build a database system for WolfMedia, a media streaming service, to maintain information on songs, artists, record labels, albums, podcasts, podcast hosts, podcast episodes, and users. The system should record payment information for artists, record labels, and podcast hosts, and generate various reports on payment summaries, subscribers, play counts, and ratings. The system must ensure data integrity, consistency and protect sensitive data in the database.


A database is a good idea for this task because it can efficiently store and manage large amounts of data, allow for easy retrieval and modification of data, and provide a structured
way of organizing data to facilitate data analysis and reporting. A database also enables data integrity and consistency by enforcing data constraints and relationships, reducing
data redundancy, and minimizing data inconsistencies. Moreover, a database management system provides security and access controls to protect sensitive data and enable multi-user
access to the database. Overall, a database system is an essential tool for managing complex data and supporting all the activities for the WolfMedia streaming service.
